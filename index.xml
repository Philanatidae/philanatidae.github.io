      <description>Hello! I&amp;rsquo;m Philanatidae, Phil for short. Welcome to my website! I&amp;rsquo;m a full-time electrical engineer who is a hobbiest computer programmer.
I became interested in programming when I was about 10 years old. The Washington State University (WSU) 4-H program hosted an annual event called &amp;lsquo;Super Saturday&amp;rsquo;, a collection of workshops. One of the workshops I attended was for Scratch, a visual programming language aimed towards children. I immediately got hooked, and spent almost all my time on the computer using Scratch.</description>

      <description>Hello! I&amp;rsquo;m Philanatidae, Phil for short. I&amp;rsquo;m a full-time electrical engineer who is a hobbiest computer programmer.
I have two projects I am actively working on. One is a game written in C# with FNA that I have been working on with a friend since August 2019. The other is a game engine that I am writing games alongside with to drive its development and architecture.</description>
